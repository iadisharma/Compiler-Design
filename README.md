# Compiler Design 

Final Year Laboratory - Fall Semester

Objective: At least 10 experiments covering the entire syllabus of the corresponding theory paper to be carried out using the theory studied /programming skill of the subject concerned to get insight into the practical applications of the theoretical studies. The outcome of the lab classes must lead to a skilled and
self-sustained program developer. Pre-requisites: Corresponding theory paper CS 1703 Compiler Design and associated prerequisites..

Course Outcome: On successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. Simulate the functioning of various phases of compilers in various problem domains.
2. Devise solutions to solve complex engineering problem.
3. Identify an optimal design among all available design alternatives for further manipulation using compiler design principles to execute the code faster.
4. Apply tools using knowledge of compilers for compiling different programs.
5. Evaluate the effectiveness of different compilation tools.
